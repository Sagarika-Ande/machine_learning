1.🧠 What is Machine Learning (ML)?

Machine Learning means teaching computers to learn from data — instead of giving them step-by-step rules.

In normal programming:
You give rules + data → output

In ML:
You give data + output → model learns rules

Supervised Learning: Trains models on labeled data to predict or classify new, unseen data.
                     Learn from labeled data and predict outputs.
📘 Example: Predict house price based on size.  Data: (size → price)

Unsupervised Learning: Finds patterns or groups in unlabeled data, like clustering or dimensionality reduction.

                       Find hidden structures or group similar data.
📊 Example: Group customers into clusters based on spending habits (no labels).

Reinforcement Learning: Learns through trial and error to maximize rewards, ideal for decision-making tasks.
                        Learn best actions through feedback.
