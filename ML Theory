1.ðŸ§  What is Machine Learning (ML)?

Machine Learning means teaching computers to learn from data â€” instead of giving them step-by-step rules.

In normal programming:
You give rules + data â†’ output

In ML:
You give data + output â†’ model learns rules

DL is subset of ML - ML is subset of AI

2. Types of Machine Learning?
Supervised Learning: Trains models on labeled data to predict or classify new, unseen data.
                     Learn from labeled data and predict outputs.
ðŸ“˜ Example: Predict house price based on size.  Data: (size â†’ price)

Unsupervised Learning: Finds patterns or groups in unlabeled data, like clustering or dimensionality reduction.
                      Find hidden structures or group similar data.
ðŸ“Š Example: Group customers into clusters based on spending habits (no labels).

Reinforcement Learning: Learns through trial and error to maximize rewards, ideal for decision-making tasks.
                       Find hidden structures or group similar data.
ðŸŽ® Example: A robot learns to walk or a game AI learns to win by getting reward points.
