1.ðŸ§  What is Machine Learning (ML)?

Machine Learning means teaching computers to learn from data â€” instead of giving them step-by-step rules.

In normal programming:
You give rules + data â†’ output

In ML:
You give data + output â†’ model learns rules

Supervised Learning: Trains models on labeled data to predict or classify new, unseen data.
                     Learn from labeled data and predict outputs.
ðŸ“˜ Example: Predict house price based on size.  Data: (size â†’ price)

Unsupervised Learning: Finds patterns or groups in unlabeled data, like clustering or dimensionality reduction.

                       Find hidden structures or group similar data.
ðŸ“Š Example: Group customers into clusters based on spending habits (no labels).

Reinforcement Learning: Learns through trial and error to maximize rewards, ideal for decision-making tasks.
                        Learn best actions through feedback.

3. Steps to Train a Machine Learning Model?

Step 1: Define the Problem

Decide what you want the model to do.
Example: Predict house prices based on features like size, bedrooms, location.
Type of ML problem: Regression (predict continuous value) or Classification (predict categories).

Step 2: Collect Data

Get data related to your problem.
Data can come from CSV files, databases, or APIs.

Step 3: Explore & Prepare Data (EDA & Preprocessing)

EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis): Understand patterns in data. Example: plot Size vs Price.
Clean Data: Handle missing values, remove duplicates.
Feature Engineering: Convert categorical data into numbers.
                    Normalize/scale values if needed.

Step 4: Split Data

Split data into:
       Training set: 70â€“80% (for training the model)
       Test/Validation set: 20â€“30% (to check performance)

Step 5: Choose a Model

Example choices:
Linear Regression â†’ continuous output (house price)
Decision Tree / Random Forest â†’ for complex patterns
Logistic Regression / SVM â†’ for classification problems

Step 6: Train the Model

Step 7: Evaluate the Model

Check how well it predicts on test data.
Metrics:
       Regression: MSE, RMSE, RÂ²
       Classification: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score

Step 8: Improve the Model

Try different models or algorithms.
Tune hyperparameters (learning rate, depth, etc.)
Add more features or data.

Step 9: Save & Use the Model
Once happy with performance, save the model,Load later to make predictions
